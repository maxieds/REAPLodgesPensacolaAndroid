# How to install the latest beta tester version of the app on Google Play Store

## Preface

While local development is going on, MDS will have binary (APK) versions of the REAP demo application available on her personal Google Developer account. There is a one-time $25/USD lifetime fee to list Android applications there. This usage makes sense to me. Any objections to the choice of policy may freely abstain from participating in the community beta testing and feedback cycles. Installing the development (henceforth, beta) versions of this application implies individual consent to reasonable things involved in testing non-production computer hacker software. 

I have a few other (older) Play Store listings whose sources are available as FREE software. These include:

## Installing the first time - TODO

## Keeping the application up-to-date - TODO

The most recent version of the beta app - in MAJOR.MINOR.SUBRELEASE/REV notation - can be found on the [releases page](TODO). 

## Manual installation from unsigned (non-trusted) binary APK - TODO
